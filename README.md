# Neural-networks-for-non-life-insurance-pricing
This page contains the code used for my thesis: Neural networks for non-life insurance pricing. The goal of my thesis is to compare neural networks and combined actuarial neural networks (CANNs) with generalized linear models (GLMs), generalized additive models (GAMs) and several tree-based machine learning methods being normal regression trees, random forests and gradient boosting machines (GBMs). These models are compared for a motor third party liability data set. The GLMs, GBMs and tree-based machine learning models were earlier constructed for both claim frequency and claim severity in Henckaerts, R., Antonio, K., Côté, M. P., & Verbelen, R. (2019): Boosting insights in insurance tariff plans with tree-based machine learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10890).
